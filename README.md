# Image-Classification-Using-HOG-Features-And-KNN

Performed Image classification  using Histogram of oriented gradients. The histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) is a feature descriptor used in computer vision and image processing for the purpose of object detection. The technique counts occurrences of gradient orientation in localized portions of an image.The feature vector obtained is trained using K-NN Classifier
